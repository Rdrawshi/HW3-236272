which allow the developer to control the sheet and get current snap position.
snappingSheetController.currentPosition;
snappingSheetController.currentSnappingPosition; 
snappingSheetController.currentlySnapping;

2.snappigPositions parameter controls this behavior - To change the snap positions for the sheet, 
change the snappingPositions parameter

3.Inkwell include ripple effect tap â€“ it produces a Material Design ripple effect when you tap or 
long tap the widget below it While GestureDetector doesn't include.
